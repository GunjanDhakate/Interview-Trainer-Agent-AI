# ✨ Overview
SmartInterview Coach is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to help users confidently prepare for job interviews. Built using IBM watsonx.ai and enhanced with RAG architecture, it delivers role-specific, real-time advice using internal data and live search.

Personalized | Context-Aware | Behavioral & Technical Insights

# 🎯 Identifying the Problem
Traditional interview prep platforms often fall short in:

⚙ Offering generalized advice

⌛ Forcing users to browse across sources

👤 Not tailoring content to job-specific roles or experience levels

# ✅ Our AI-Driven Approach
Our solution addresses these pain points by:

🔍 Detecting intent to recognize the user’s job role

🌐 Searching both a curated internal knowledge base and the web

🧠 Using IBM Granite LLM for natural, structured responses

# 💡 Key Capabilities
👩‍💼 Profession-based interview simulations

🌍 On-demand dynamic info for niche roles

💬 STAR format behavioral answers

💡 Technical & soft-skill guidance

🧘 Human-like, interactive experience

🔒 Domain-limited to interview coaching only
